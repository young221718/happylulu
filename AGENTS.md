# HappyLulu Agent Guide

## Scope

HappyLulu is a native Swift macOS menu bar utility. Source, tests, packaging,
and Korean user documentation belong to this repository.

## Working rules

- Read the current Git status and checkout identity before editing. Preserve
  unrelated changes and user attendance data.
- When used inside Hive, `develop/` is the baseline directory on `main`.
  New manually managed feature checkouts use direct sibling `<task>/` directories
  and `codex/` branches; preserve existing checkout and branch names. Compare
  their common Git directory before reuse.
- Use the smallest useful workflow. Material behavior changes require an
  independent review after relevant checks; simple docs need no extra agents.
- Keep attendance on the local Mac. Do not add network collection or accounts
  without an explicit feature request.
- Preserve the existing `AfterSix` storage path and bundle identifier unless
  a migration is deliberately implemented and verified.
- Keep the installed production app named `happylulu`. Development and QA GUI
  apps must use only `happylulu-dev` and the fixed existing bundle identifier
  `local.chanyoung.HappyLulu.Dev.manual-leave.20261015`; never create or launch
  additional QA, date-suffixed, or UUID app identities. Preserve the existing
  Dev data path. Synthetic QA must isolate its data and preferences, must never
  delete the fixed Dev preferences, and must reject concurrent Dev sessions.
  Use `scripts/check-ai-usage-ui.sh` for the synthetic fixture and verify that
  the menu-bar app list has no extra entries after local GUI checks.
- Do not count wake or session activation as an unlock event. Do not fabricate
  historical attendance when the app was not running.
- Never lock, log out, or reboot the user's Mac to run validation without
  explicit authorization.
- Keep `.build/`, `dist/`, app bundles, credentials, and personal state out of
  Git. `Resources/HappyLuluIcon.png` is the reviewed application source asset.
- Require an explicit user request for this repository and publication action
  before pushing, creating or updating a PR, releasing, or deploying. A request
  for local changes or successful checks alone does not authorize publication.
- User documentation and reports are normally Korean; keep this guide English.

## Checks

```sh
swift run --build-system native AfterSixChecks
bash scripts/build-app.sh
bash -n scripts/build-app.sh
plutil -lint Resources/Info.plist
git diff --check
```

Use the existing macOS Command Line Tools; do not install dependencies merely
to run checks. Unit checks, build/signature validation, actual unlock detection,
and login-after-reboot behavior are separate evidence. Record their limits.

## Safe personal maintenance

- Keep attention on the requested repository and demonstrated defects. Use small,
  testable changes; preserve the operator's data and unfinished work.
- Reproduce a defect with a failing check before fixing it. Run relevant regression
  checks and obtain independent review for behavior changes before claiming done.
- Inspect branch ancestry, dirty/ignored files, and active work before integration.
  Preserve unique commits and unfinished checkouts. Clean up only confirmed merged,
  clean, inactive task branches within explicit cleanup authorization.
- Report executed checks, review findings, commit/merge evidence, and remaining
  blockers. Completion requires verified results. Deployment needs its own request.
